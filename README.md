# MD5_project
The main objective of our project is to demonstrate our understanding of password-based authentication. Our program is written in C++. We are implementing a scheme that can be found on all UNIX variants as well as on a number of other operating systems. It is a widely used password security technique that uses hashed passwords and a salt value. The program consists of creating a password file containing the user IDs, the salt values, and hash codes. Once the file is created and populated, the program proceeds to authenticate the password. It then ends by running the rainbow table implementation in order to crack the password.
